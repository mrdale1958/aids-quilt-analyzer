# AIDS Quilt Crowdsourced Image Analyzer

A modern web application for analyzing and annotating AIDS Memorial Quilt blocks through crowdsourced contributions. This project helps preserve the history of the AIDS Memorial Quilt by enabling volunteers to identify and mark the centers of individual panels within quilt blocks.

## 🎯 Purpose

The AIDS Memorial Quilt is one of the most significant works of community folk art in the world. This application helps digitally preserve and analyze quilt blocks by crowdsourcing the identification of individual panel boundaries, enabling better archival and research capabilities.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Image Analysis**: Click on numbered overlay points to mark panel centers
- **Quality Control**: Options to flag blocks that need re-cropping or aren't standard 8-panel blocks
- **Session Tracking**: Keep track of blocks analyzed in each session
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-time Statistics**: Dashboard showing progress and completion rates
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with Node.js, React, and SQLite

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Frontend**: React with Vite
**Backend**: Node.js with Express
**Database**: SQLite
**Styling**: CSS with responsive design

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Blocks
- `GET /api/block/:id` - Get specific block data
- `GET /api/block/incomplete/next` - Get next incomplete block
- `POST /api/orientation` - Submit block analysis data

### Statistics
- `GET /api/stats/completed` - Get completed blocks count
- `GET /api/stats/total` - Get total blocks count
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint

## 💾 Database Schema

### Blocks Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE blocks (
    blockID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    needsRecrop INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    completed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    started INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    not8Panel INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    orientation_data TEXT,
    ip_address TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Panels Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE panels (
    panelID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    blockID INTEGER,
    panel_number INTEGER,
    x_coord INTEGER,
    y_coord INTEGER,
    width INTEGER,
    height INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (blockID) REFERENCES blocks(blockID)
);
```

## 🎮 How to Use

### For Analysts
1. **Dashboard**: View statistics and start analyzing blocks
2. **Image Analysis**: 
   - Click numbered points closest to each of the 8 panel centers
   - Mark blocks that need re-cropping
   - Indicate blocks that aren't standard 8-panel layouts
3. **Submit**: Save your analysis and move to the next block

### For Developers
1. **Adding Images**: Place quilt block images in `/public/images/`
2. **Database Management**: Use SQLite browser or command line tools
3. **API Testing**: Use the `/api/health` endpoint to verify server status

## 🛠️ Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev        # Start both frontend and backend in development mode
npm run server     # Start only the backend server
npm run client     # Start only the frontend development server
